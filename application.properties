On 2023-12-03 at 12:45:12, an ERROR message was logged, indicating an unauthorized access attempt from the IP address 192.168.1.1. This suggests that someone tried to gain access to the system without proper authorization, which could be a security concern.\n\n2. Just one minute later, on 2023-12-03 at 12:46:15, an INFO message was logged, stating that the user 'admin' successfully logged in. This could potentially be related to the unauthorized access attempt in the previous log, as it indicates that an authorized user (admin) was able to log in successfully around the same time.\n\nIt's important to investigate further to understand the context of these events and any potential security implications. Additional logs and information may be needed to determine the extent of the unauthorized access attempt and to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to prevent further incidents.",

Waiting for active requests to complete.\n   - Graceful shutdown complete.\n\n2. The application named \"HealerApplication\" is starting up with Java version 17.0.12.\n   - It is using the default profile.\n   \n3. Tomcat is being initialized with port 8080 for the embedded server.\n   - Service Tomcat is starting.\n   - Servlet engine Apache Tomcat/10.1.33 is starting.\n\n4. The Spring embedded WebApplicationContext is being initialized.\n\n5. There is a warning indicating that the template location cannot be found at classpath:/templates/.\n\n6. Tomcat is successfully started on port 8080 with the context path '/'.\n\n7. HealerApplication has been successfully started in 0.913 seconds, and the process has been running for 1.121 seconds.\n\n8. A Spring DispatcherServlet named 'dispatcherServlet' is being initialized.\n\nOverall, these logs provide information about the startup, initialization, and shutdown processes of the HealerApplication using Spring and Tomcat as the embedded server. The warning regarding the template location may need to be addressed for proper functioning of the application.",
